Sparks can be bonfires and ruin everything.
Believing the saying and yourself,the mankind can finish everything he should do.
It's the reason that ST appears in the virtual currency world.
----------------------------

The original intention of ST is to solve the exploitation and oppression of small capital representatives such as retail investors by market makers and big capital. The core of virtual currency is decentralization, and the core value of decentralization is to resist supervision and gain absolute freedom. But absolute freedom inevitably brings unlimited oppression of the strong against the weak.

Exploitation is common in the world of virtual currencies, but I want to change all of this. The source of the change starts with the creation of ST. ST will use a large number of methods to protect the rights and interests of retail investors, not because the currency holdings account for a considerable proportion The rights and interests of big dealers. In many virtual currencies, big dealers have used information gaps and differences in various resources countless times to frantically start zero-sum games and transfer the capital in retail wallets to their pockets little by little. Go. But these common means of exploitation in traditional virtual currencies will be suppressed infinitely in ST, and even eliminated as much as possible through various means.

In the development process of ST, the difference in strength between bookmakers and retail investors will rarely tend to balance or even flip.

ST will impose a selling limit on holders whose currency holdings exceed 1% of the currency circulation. If the holdings exceed this amount, selling will become a more difficult thing. Such holders want It takes at least half a day to clear out the tokens in his hand-if he uses MetaMask with Pancake professional mode for uninterrupted operation, the time can be controlled within half a day. If he does not do this, the time may exceed Everyone's imagination. Under the control of this mechanism, it will be difficult for a super currency holder to achieve his great cause of smashing the market.XD

In addition, ST also has a very powerful big lottery mechanism-a lucky token holder will be randomly selected every once in a while, and given a double or some token reward-the specific reward, this may require Explore it yourself, or search slowly in the source code. Let us leave a little suspense for this retail carnival feast, dear coin holders.
----------------------------
Good Luck.
